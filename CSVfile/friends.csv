Why do all youre coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?#3
Oh. Thats so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, Wheres number 27?!#1
Y'know what?#2
It didnt.#2
Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what Ive got with Alice.#1
Now, wh-what, what is that like?#3
Its so cool man, its so, its just cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.#1
Yeah, yeah.#2
Why cant I find that?#1
Dont ask me, I had it and I blew it!#0
Well, I want it!#1
You can have it!#1
I dont know, maybe I cant. I mean, maybe theres something wrong with me.#1
Oh, no! No!#1
Its out there man! Ive seen it! I got it!!#1
Then you hold on to it!!#1
All right, man!!#1
All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!#1
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.#2
Push!#1
Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder.#1
Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out!#1
Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho.#1
Let's  I was justyeah, right.#1
Push!#1
Push!#1
Okay.#2
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?#2
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.#1
Okay, go left. Left! Left!#3
Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!#0
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head!#1
Straight up over your head!#1
You can do it!#1
You can do it!#1
Okay.#2
You got it?#2
Oh, okay, I get it.#2
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even#3
Howard's the#2
Yes but too me he's just, man.#2
Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.#1
Ugh, can you believe that guy!#3
Yeah. I really like his glasses.#2
Ohh!#3
What?#2
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!#3
Oh my God!#3
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.#2
Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!#3
Oh wait, Joey, you cant go like that! You stink!#3
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I dont have time!#1
Theyre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.#2
Youre coming on to the entire room!  Im Chandler.#1
Hi.#2
Hi.#2
You mind if I#2
No, please.#2
So uh, what are you in for?#2
I talk in my sleep.#2
What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep.#2
So why dont you give me your number?#2
Previously on Friends.#2
I dont know exactly. Its-its sorta like wrestling.#2
Oh?!#3
Yeah, but without the costumes.#2
Oh.#2
And its not fake, its totally brutal.#2
Yeah, its two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Theyre#2
So you can like, bite, and pull peoples hair and stuff?#3
Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.#2
Whats fish hooking?#3
Huh, whats fish hooking...   Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?#2
What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.#1
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.#1
Well, that makes me feel so good.#1
It was just so awkward and bumpy.#2
Bumpy?#3
Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with.#2
And uh maybe you have to get used to it.#2
Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?#1
Coming through!  Oh! Coming through!  Oh! Hello! Hi!  No! Right! Coming through!#1
Oh well, its not so bad.#2
Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.#3
Oh!#3
My God!#3
Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?#2
Excuse me?#3
Joey! Hes working!  You would look#1
Oh, how bad is it?#1
Oh, its bad. Its really bad. The only thing in there that isnt burned is an ass. Which I do#3
Hows your room Rach?#2
Everythings ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.#3
Isnt that mine?#2
Fine! Im sorry for your loss!#1
So uh, youre not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?#2
Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am#1
Yes, they can stay with us.#2
Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?#2
Theres just so much pressure.#1
I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different.#2
I dont know if youd understand.#2
Yeah, none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.#2
Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!#1
Well, yknow.#2
I mean theres no way Joeys gonna make it in time.#3
So Im gonna go through the hotel and see if theres any other weddings going on.#2
Okay. Oh but dont tell them Monicas pregnant because they frown on that.#2
Okay.#2
Okay.#2
Whats all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!#1
Ross, we can handle this.#2
Well, apparently not, and I cant just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly.#3
I mean, enough of the silliness!#0
Well, why dont you tell her to stop being silly!#0
Okay-okay!#1
Two very good points, look Ive known you both a long time, and Ive never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youve been since youve got together.#1
Do you really want to throw that all away over a room?#1
That is so silly.#1
Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?#2
Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.#2
Love is the best medicine.#1
Thats laughter.#1
Why do you do it?#2
I dont know.#2
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?#2
Yeah, I do.#2
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, dont ya?#2
Yes.#2
Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!#1
Oh.#2
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.#2
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.#2
You're not? See, that's why you're so great!#3
Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.#2
Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me!#1
Define me!#1
Love me, I need love!#1
'.#2
Have you really done this before?#3
Yeah!#1
Yeah!#1
Yeah!#1
You just take a big, big swing.#2
Now, dont hold back.#2
and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)#2
Hey!#1
Hey-hey-hey!#1
What are you doing?#2
Were just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.#1
Oh, all right.#2
Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.#1
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.#1
Okay!#1
All right.#2
Bye!#2
Bye!#2
Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!#1
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?#2
Yeah.#2
Listen uh, Id prefer it if you didnt call me Joey.#2
Since I dont know anyone here, I thought itd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.#2
Hey, dragon! Heres your tips from Monday and Tuesday.#2
Theres like-theres like 300 bucks in this one!#3
Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.#2
Okay.#2
Could the waiters gather around to hear tonights specials?#2
Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagWhy is nobody writing these down?#1
Because we can remember them.#2
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?#1
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played#2
I was always Joanne.#2
Question. Was ah, Egg the Gellers! the war cry of your neighbourhood?#2
Ewww! Oh! Its the Mattress King!#3
Booo!!#1
Dont look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!#3
Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.#1
What a wank!#0
Oh, I cannot believe hes using our divorce to sell mattresses.#0
I know!#1
And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves.#1
And Im appalled for you by the way.#1
You had to do it, didnt you? You couldnt just leave it alone.#1
Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when theres a bug in my food.#3
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.#0
Yeah, Im gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.#3
Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?#2
Im, Im freaking out!#3
Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldnt have!#3
All right, I havent lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something.#2
Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?#2
Um. yeah.#2
I am#2
All right, look, heres the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay.#2
So, Ill invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.#2
Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesnt work.#1
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but thats why you have got to be the bigger man here.#2
Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldnt make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say Like me!#1
Like me tiny doctor!#1
Okay, well cant you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?#1
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay were never gonna get along.#1
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay.#0
Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I dont wanna have to have a separate room for you too!#1
!#0
Okay, okay, okay.  Ill get the bagels.#2
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?#2
All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.#2
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.#2
Really? A purse?#3
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.#1
It looks like a women's purse.#2
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look,#2
See look,#2
Exactly! Unisex!#2
Maybe you need sex.#2
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.#1
Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.#2
So, um, have you told your parents?#2
No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .#2
Here you go.#2
You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who.#2
.#2
.#2
no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't think either answer would make me feel better.#1
I love you Phoebe.#1
So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.#3
Hey!#1
Hi.#2
I just came over to drop offnothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?#2
Yeah, it did.#1
So, I guess this is over.#3
What?#2
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.#3
Why, exactly?#1
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.#3
Chandler that's crazy!#3
If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer thanOhhh!#0
So, this isn't over?#2
You are so cute!#1
No.#1
No, it was a fight.#2
You deal with it and move on!#1
It's nothing to freak out about.#2
Really? Okay. Great!#1
Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!#1
We're in a relationship?#3
I'm afraid so.#2
Okay.#2
Hi!#1
So you like the short hair better.#2
What? YetiI mean Danny?#2
Can I tell you a little secret?#2
Yeah!#1
I want to keep one.#2
Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!#1
Oh, please.#2
What? Honey.#2
Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.#2
Oh God, Im so sorry.#3
I know.#2
Ow!!#1
Oh God!#3
Hey, you guys! Guess what?#1
Got a job on a river boat?#2
Y'know what I didnt wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? Youre not my girlfriend anymore so...#1
Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.#2
Right.#2
Now that youre on youre own, youre free to look as stupid as you like.#1
You like it right?#2
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! Im kidding!#2
Yeah, come here!#2
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?#2
Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!#2
Okay, good bye!#0
Hey I got one! I got one!#1
Hi!#1
Hi.#2
Oh uh, up or down?#2
Oh down please.  I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?#1
Could you press up too please?#2
Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.#3
Oh yeah? Howd yours happen?#2
Well, its a long story.#2
Its kind of embarrassing.#2
Lets just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.#1
How about you?#2
Car accident.#3
Oh.#2
Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasnt paying attention?#1
Yeah. Me.  Oh hey, thats me.  Hey uh, I take it youre just visiting someone.#2
Uh-huh, yeah.#2
Well umm, if you have sometime yknow and maybe you might want to visit someone else#2
Oh yeah! I-I would like that.#1
Im in the middle#2
Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!#0
Uh, you gotta press the button.#2
Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.#2
Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.#3
Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.    We're way ahead of the game.#2
Oh my god.#3
What?#3
There's something new in the bowl.#3
Look, we have enough, just walk away.#1
No, but I want...I want the pinecones!#1
There's a forest right outside.#2
It's not the same.#2
Ok, go quick!#1
Thank you for a delightful stay.#1
Oh, my maple candy!#1
Oh my God, what happened?#3
Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!#1
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.#1
Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.#1
Ross's what?#3
You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.#3
Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?#2
Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! Thats my Dad, thats Frank! Yeah! Im sorry Im getting all flingy.#3
Take it easy--if you want, theres cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!#1
No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.#2
Oh.#2
Well, so, umm, anyway umm, Ive been, Ive been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?#2
Oh no, I-Im sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.#3
Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.#2
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.#2
Oh, what? What was it?#3
The three losers.#1
Oh, poor Lily.#3
Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.#3
Yeah, no, it was great.#1
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her,  burping her, oh try this one!#3
Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!#0
Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby  close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.#2
Ok.#2
It worked!#3
Oh  oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit.#1
Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it  won’t stop crying.#1
Umm, she Rach, not it, she.#2
Yeah, I’m not so sure.#2
Oh my god, I am losing my mind.#1
Yeah, no kidding, this just proves no good can come from  having sex with Ross!#1
Well, youre not.#2
Oh, its so easy for you I mean, youre not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!#3
Yeah I can!  And dont think I dont, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!#1
Monica. Youve, youve done it right?#3
Of course I have! What do you think, Im some 30 year old virgin?#0
Oh my God! Youre a 30 year old virgin!#3
Say it louder, I dont think the guy all the way in the back heard you!#3
Its not like, I havent any opportunities.#0
I mean, yknow, Im just waiting for the perfect guy.#2
Im seeing this guy Roger, all right?#2
Hes not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with.#2
Yknow, give him my flower.#2
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, youve waited#3
Yknow what? You are right?!#3
Yes!!#1
I mean sex does not have to be a big deal!#1
There shouldnt be all this rules and restrictions!#1
Yknow, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever#2
Rachel! Im never gonna think its okay for you to cheat on your husband!#1
Oh what do you know? Virgin!#1
Push, push!#2
We're here!#1
Where have you been?#2
Long story, honey.#2
All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this?#2
C'mon up.#2
Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.#1
So, I hear, you hate me!#0
I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.#2
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.#1
And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...#1
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey.#0
So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.#2
But what does that gonna do...#1
For Chandler!#1
Guess what, I got an audition!#1
Awww, one of my students got an audition. Im so proud.#1
I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?#2
You bet! Whats the part?#1
Oh its great, its a role on#1
Hi!  Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?#2
I thought he was with you.#2
He-he was with me umm, were playing a little game, yknow? Hide and seek.#2
You cant ask us son, thats cheating.#2
Youre right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.#2
Well, he better not come by here. He cant see the bride in the wedding dress.#2
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.#1
But that was after the wedding, its not bad luck then.#2
Honey, it isnt good luck.#2
Oh my God! Monica!#3
I know! Hey, hows Chandler doin?#2
Great. Hes doing great. Dont you worry about Chandler.#2
Are you okay?#2
Uh-huh.#2
Yeah baby!#1
Im really glad you guys are okay but, I just keep thinking what would happen if-if you two  actually had hooked up.#2
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?#2
Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!#1
I cant believe it! He still hasnt called.#1
Who, Josh?#3
Its Joshua.#1
What, he doesnt like Josh?#3
No, I dont.#3
All right, well Im gonna put my sweats back on.#2
Oh no!#3
Wait!#3
Wait!#3
Okay, yknow what, you were right, you were right.#1
We really werent great at being guys, but you know why?#1
Because were girls.#2
Phoebe, his music could not#2
Thank you, thanks.#1
Yeah, I lost it.#1
Yknow, Im not gonna play anymore,  would you, can you finish my set?#2
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.#3
Yeah, like I could#2
What?#3
I played bad on purpose guys.#1
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.#3
Yeahno, just that last song.#2
Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.#2
Oh yeah, whos playing?#2
The players.#2
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.#2
Please, its a relief is what it is, is what it is.#2
All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!#2
Oh.#2
Anything?#2
No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasnt heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandlers parents again!#1
You told them he was missing?#1
No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think Im interested in them.#2
Whose is it?#2
I dont want to say.#2
Oh, come on! I dont care! Come on! Whose is it?#1
Diane Keaton.#2
Phoebe! Come on! Lets go!  Come on!  Why arent you dressed yet?!#0
Im sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.#2
No, Phoebe, Ill tell you what, if you get ready now Ill let you play it at the wedding.#2
Really?!#3
Oh thats so exciting!#1
Thank you!#1
Thanks Mon!#1
Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Ill have to pound on you for a little bit.#0
Fair enough, now go get ready!#2
Okay.#2
Ill get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my Im sorry, uh apparently Ive opened the door to the past.#2
My best shoes, so good to me.#1
I wear them everyday.#1
Down at the heel, holes in the toes.#1
Dont care what people say.#1
My feets best friends, pals to the end.#1
With them Im one hot chicky.#1
Though late one night, not much light, I....#2
I stepped in something icky.#1
Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time Ill.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.#1
God, its gonna so weird like when I come home and youre not here.#3
Yknow?#2
No more Joey and Chans.#3
No more J and Cs.#3
"""You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlers?"""#2
"""Cant, its not there."""#2
Look, Im just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.#2
Yeah but we wont be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.#3
Not once did we do that.#2
Hi.#2
Hey!#2
Hi.#2
So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.#2
Oh yeah? Well, howd she take it?#2
Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnt cry. She wasnt angry or sad.#2
Uh-huh.#2
Im not going to do that.#2
Okay, if you need the vacuum, its in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator#2
Okay, okay, but Rachels gonna be here too, cant I just ask her this stuff?#2
Yeah, okay, give that a try!#2
All right! Lets do it!#1
Woo-hoo!!#1
Yeah, cheerie-o!#1
London baby!#1
Hi!#1
Hi!#1
Monica? What time is it?#2
Uhh, 9.#2
But it's dark out.#2
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.#2
I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.#2
I'm#2
I know, me too.#2
Hey!#1
Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend?#1
Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.#1
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.#1
Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.#2
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!#1
Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.#2
Wait! What about Joey?#2
Oh umm, theres also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.  What is that?#2
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.#2
Im so sorry!#1
Sorry!#1
You didnt bring#2
Hey!#1
Hi!#1
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.#2
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.#2
To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, youre#3
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.#2
Oh, youre switching apartments?#3
Its not for me, its for Rachel.#2
But Rachel has an apartment.#2
Yeah, but when the baby comes shes gonna want to move.#2
She is?#3
Yeah, you didnt expect her to live there with a baby did you?#3
I guess I didnt really think about it.#2
Ezel!  Hey Gunther! Youre an ezel!#1
Damnit!#0
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?#3
Little village people.#2
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.#1
Oh, that is so sweet!#1
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!#1
Huh. Except, Phoebes not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.#2
Because shes not gonna get to keep the babies.#3
Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!#3
Wait a minute!#3
Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after shes done being pregnant.#1
Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.#2
Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants shes always wanted!#1
Oh, shes gonna love that!#1
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?#2
Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.#2
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.#2
Fine, Im mentally unstable.#0
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.#2
What?!#3
Uh yes, heroin and crack.#2
Crack isnt even an intravenous drug!#0
Well, you would know.#2
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?#2
Oh, come on!#1
Ross, please, I found the magazines!#1
No!#1
Phoebe just because I'm alone doesnt mean I wanna walk around naked.#2
I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.#2
Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?#1
I know, I lied! I didnt want her to think I was a terrible mother! I cant even see my own baby!#3
Oh sure, come here!  Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,  its-its-its, its right there .#2
Oh. Oh, its beautiful. I see it now.#1
Do you really?#2
No, I dont see it!#0
Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this?  This tiny thing that looks like a peanut?#1
Yeah.#2
Sweetie thats it.#1

Youre welcome.#2

We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.#1
Will you stop!#1
Okay. All right.#2
Okay, all right, I think youre great, I think youre sweet, and youre smart, and I love you.#1
But you will always be the guy who peed on me.#3
Hey!#1
Hey!#1
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!#1
Hey, check me out, Im a slut!#1
So you uh, want to do something tonight?#2
Oh I cant. Dr. Roger is coming over again.#2
Oh.#2
Oh right!#3
Right!#3
Because youre still seeing him and uh, hes a good guy.#3
I mean, I remember a time when#3
Are you okay?#2
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?#1
Great! Its so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was#1
I bet he can.#2
Yknow, I dont have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure youre okay?#2
Oh yeah! Yeah! Dont worry about me, Ill be fine!#1
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.#2
Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.#2
Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.#1
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there    is a reason why we can't have a baby?#1
Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine.#2
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks.#1
I can't believe    I didn't even think of that.#3
I guess I was just so worried about having to...    come here and do... 'that'...#1
What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you    can't do it at a doctor's office?#1
"It was a ""Wendy's!!    """#1
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!#3
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else?#3
Like you, I dont even know where you work?#3
Yeah.#2
Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a#1
Hey.#2
Hey!#2
So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.#0
Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Ill show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.#2
Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.#1
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?#1
Yeah!#1
Well, Im not going to go now anyway .#2
Okay .#2
Here you go.#2
Ah, Gunther, I cant pay for this right now because Im not working, so Ive had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin for stuff.#2
Well, if you want, you can work here.#2
Uh, I dont know.#2
Ya see, its just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yknow?#2
And to go from that to this, I just Plus, Id have to wait on all my friends.#3
Okay, but the moneys good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.#2
What?!#3
Flexible hours.#2
Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?#2
I have no name.#2
All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?#2
Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.#2
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.#3
Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?#3
Umm, Gene.#2
Its Clint. Its Clint!#0
See you later, Gene.#2

Come on Joey!!!#1
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night!#1
Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.#2
I can't believe you would say that!#1
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.#2
No! I mean come on! This is a#1
I don't know.#2
Is he romantic with her?#1
I don't know.#2
Are they in love?#1
I don't know.#2
You don't know anything.#0
Ohh, I know one thing!#1
What?#1
They did it right there on the couch.#1
Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in.#1
I mean, that guy with the toe thing?#1
Who's he sleeping with?#2
Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad...#2
I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.#2
Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!#1
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting    is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.#2
So where did you study?#2
Oh, I didn't go to college.#2
No, where did you study acting?#2
Molly ... people don't study acting ...#2
Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?#2
Sure, I'll go check on Emma.#2
Thanx.#2
Will the stable boy never get the princess??#3
What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here    on my couch?#3
No ... the leather sticks to my ass.#1
You know, this isn't fair.#0
What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?#0
Huh?#1
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?#0
Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok?#1
I didn't think I could ever love again.#3
Come on! Joe!#1
Ok#2
Hi, is Molly here?#2
Yeah, come on in. Molly?#2
Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha .  I'll see you tomorrow.#2
Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess    we have no problem.#2

And whats cool is, the character is from Naples, right?#1
Yeah.#2
My whole familys from Naples!#1
Oh thats great! Okay, well Ive heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie#3
Joey, this is the awkward part.#1
Oh!#3

This rooms available.#2
Okay!#1

Since I have been waiting four women, thats four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies!#1
Im next!#0
Its my turn!#0
Its only fair!#0
And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me Im going to sue you!#0
Not this hospital, Im going to sue you!#0
And my husband  hes a lawyer!#1
Uh Rach#2
Go get back on that case honey!#0
I dont think the next patient is very far along.#2
Okay, well then bring her in.#2
OH.MY.GAWD!!!#3
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that oneDude! Theyre all huge!#3
They dont look any bigger than me!#1
Well, maybe thats because youre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.#1
Im just going to say hi to the lads. All right?#2
All right.#2
Okay.#2
Hi.#2
Whoa!  I kinda liked it.#1
Okay, I know what I have to do. Ive got to go Red Ross.  Yknow, Red Ross!#1
I totally dont know what youre talking about.#1
Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for#1
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.#1
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, well be supportive like crazy.#2
Yeah.#2
We just want you to think it through.#2
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whos had a baby. Like your mom?#2
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.#2
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.#2
Thank you. All right.#2
Come, sit.#2
Sit.#2
Sit!#0
Umm, all righty, before we get started I justI need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.#2
Lucky sixes....#2
Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.#2
Hi!#2
And Joey....#2
Hi!#2
And Ross.#2
Hi!#2
He doesn't speak much English.#2
Look at that!#3
So, um... where did Paolo come from?#2
Oh... Italy, I think.#2
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.#2
Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!#2
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.#2
Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.#2
Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.#2
Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.#1
Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.#2
You betcha!#1
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!#3
When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.#2
That cup is mine!#0
No its not! You want it, youre gonna have to win it!#0
All right, so are we not having dinner at all?#1
Why?#1
Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.#2
Okay.#2
You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.#2
I know I do.#2
Hi.#2
Hi.#2
Guess what?#2
What?#2
They published my paper.#1
Oh, really, let me see, let me see.#1
Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is.#1
Oh my God.#3
You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.#2
Oh.#2
What?! You got us evicted!!#0
I told you not to go down there!#0
Well he made Rachel cry!#3
Rachel always cries!#0
Thats not true!#0
Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like youve never sucked before!#2
All right! Ill try! But if I cant, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.#2
Go!!#0
All right, all right, all right.#2
I mean Ill have to check with him first, but Ill think hell be cool with it.#2
So, hes just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesnt want anything in exchange for helping him?#1
Well, I assume Ill have to take showers with him, but y'know, thats true of any job.#2
How ya feelin?#2
Well, my apartment isnt there anymore, because I drank it.#2
Whered you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.#2
Yeah.#2
Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.#2
Woooo hoooo!!!#1
Ow, no woo-hooing, no woo-hooing.#1
Why, what happened?#3
Ah, I fooled around with Joeys sister.  Well, thats not the worst part.#1
What is the worse part?#2
I cant remember which sister.#1
You see what men do! Dont tell me men are not nice!  This is men!!#0
Whats wrong with you?#1
Nothing!#0
Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havent been able to stand up since.#3
But um, I dont think its anything serious.#2
This sounds like a hernia. You have toyou-youGo to the doctor!#3
No way!#0
Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything its gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!#1
Why did I have to start working out again?#3
Damn you 15s!#0
Its a trifle.#2
Its got all of these layers.#2
First theres a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch.#2
[Joey and Ross make impressed faces] Then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sautéed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethings wrong.]#1
then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!#2
It tastes like feet!#3
I like it.#1
Are you kidding?#3
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?#2
No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.#2
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!#1
Oh, oh! It's on again!#1
You guys, can we please not watch this all right.#3
Shhhh!#0
Folks, has this ever happened to you.#2
You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.#2
Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!#1
And there is Kevin.#2
Can we please turn this off?#1
Noo way, Kevin.#1
There is a revolutionary new product that guarantees that you'll never have to open up milk cartons again. Meet the Milk Master 2000.#2
Are you intrigued?#3
You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!#1
Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.#1
Go ahead.#2
This works with any milk carton.#2
Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.#3
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.#2
She is not  Shes gay. Oh my God. She is#1
Good day for married people huh?#3
Im sorry your husband cheated on you.#3
Im sorry your wife is gay. I guess women arent that great either.#1
Try telling my wife that.#1
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?#2
I can't wait to be with you!#1
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.#2
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.#2
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?#1
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big#1
Arghh!!#3
I cant believe Im going to lose this job!#1
Oh Im so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?#3
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.#2
Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.#2
Yeah?#2
Well, I dont want to talk to you Wayne!#0
I hate you!#0
You ruined my life!#0
Oh, Chandler, Wayne.#2
Wayne, Chandler.#2
Hi, how are ya?#2
Joey, Joey, I-I-Ill g-get you your job back if you help me out.#2
Why should I help you?!#1

What do you need?#2
I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, yknow Sarah?#2
What?#3
And I too am just a love machine.#2
Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.#2
Oh, I thought this was your party and it turns out its a party for Howard. He's just the sweetest little man!#3
See ya Phoebe! Oh and hey, thanks for chipping in!#1
You chipped in?!#3
Yeah, uh-huh, a 100 dollars.#2
Phoebe! I can't believe you gave them money! I thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money!#3
Yeah, but they didn't ask me!#1
Y'know?#1
This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger.#1
That's always fun to be.#1
Yeah, but you're making me look bad!#0
No I'm not.#2
No!#3
If anything I'm making you look better!#1
They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!#1
Oh hey, Pheebs!#1
Hey!#1
Oh hey, Ross.#2
Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people.#3
Something to think about.#2
Yeah, okay, my bad.#1
Alright, alright, alright...#2
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.#2
For what?#2
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!#1
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.#3
Thank you!#1
Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.#2
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!#1
C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!#3
I warned you...#2
Who is being loud?#0
Oh, that would be Monica.#2
Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.#2
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?#3
Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..#2
Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?#3
No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.#2
'Kay?#2
Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life?#2
Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?#2
Sure.#2
Oh, um, Chandler?#2
Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.#2
Hey Monica, it's Joey!#1
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!#1
Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!#2
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?#2
Do you have a dressing room?#2
Do you have a chair with your name on it?#2
Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on.#2

Wow, you guys, this is big.#3
Pants and a sweater?#1
Why, mom?#1
Who am I gonna meet in a blackout?#1
Power company guys?#1
Eligible looters?#1

OK.#2
Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?#2
Well, I never call#2
What cha doing?#2

Chicks dont swim.#2

Sure.#2
See, I told you they dont swim.#2
Wait. Give him a minute.#2
Noo!  Oh, its okay, its okay, baby, baby, baby.#3
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?#2
You guys feel safe.#2
Right?#2
"Okay, Im gonna take that spit bubble as, ""Yeah, I do!"""#2
Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Ill set you up with a clean one.#2
Okay, Im sorry.#3
I didnt mean to scare you.#3
I just have to clean that up.#2
Okay?#2
Cause lets face it, were at Monicas.#2
I broke it.#1
All right.#2
Well, thats just the way that goes.#2
Okay, good.#2
Why are there only two of you?#1
Where is Leslie?#1
Well, you cant answer.#2
Leslie?#2
Where are you Leslie?#3
Leslie, now would be a#1
Hey!#1
Hey.#2
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?#1
Oh, theres banana on it.#2
You said she was bald.#1
Yeah, she was bald, shes not now.#2
How could you not tell me that she has hair?#3
I dont know, I hardly ever say that about people.#2
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!#0
Well Im sorry, I thought you said it was okay.#1
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got#1
Well, maybe it wont work out. Maybe Ross wont like her personality.#1
Why, does she have a bad personality?#2
Oh no, Bonnies the best!#1
Hey!#1
Hey.#2
Do you have a minute? Id like to talk to you about something Im, Im really uncomfortable talking about.#3
Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?#1
I actually had a topic in mind! Im, Im kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.#1
Whoa, for like months?#3
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff yknow, sexually?#1
No!#3
Oooh, wrong answer.#2
Ow! My ass. Okay. Okay.  Oh, shhh!#1
No! No!! Its me! Its me! I-I didnt want to make any noise!#1
Then don't break in!!#1
Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.#1
I have the lung capacity of a two year old.#2
Then why are you smoking?#3
Well its very unsettling.#1
Honey, I was wondering....#2
Hmm?#2
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?#1
Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.#1
Hmm.#2
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.#1
You remember not having sex in high school, right?#1
Yeah.#3
Well honey, what about you?#2
What?#2
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?#2
No.#2
Come on you gotta have one!#3
Ugh!#3
I dont know Monica.#1
It feels funny just being here.#1
I mean if you buy a bed from Janices ex-husband, thats like betraying Chandler.#1
Not at these prices.#1
Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store.  Woo!#1
Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.#1
Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandlers your friend...  Oh!#3
Oh my God!#3
Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.#1
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.#1
Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?#1
By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.#0
That's OK.#2
Oh, are you sure?#3
Really?#3
Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.#0
We can't do that.#2
What? What can't you do?#3
She really said that?#3
Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part...#2
But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.#2
'Tonight' tonight?#3
Well, I think it's perfect.#1
Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...#2
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.#1
Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.#1
Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.#3
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?#2
No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.#2
Alright, well, be good, I love you.#1
You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.#0
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.#3
Really stupid.#0
Really stupid.#1
And I don't even know how it happened.#1
I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again.#3
Are we okay now?#3
Yeah. No. No...#0
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.#2
Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.#2
You're kidding.#3
"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""#2
Oh there it is.#2
Thats not your regular dry cleaners.#2
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one.#3
I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store#3
What?!#3
A new grocery store.#2
The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and thats what they gave me?#1
When I get up there Im going to kick some ass.#0
Dont worry Phoebe, youre gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.#2
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.#2
Oh, you didnt have to come in with me.#2
Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like#1
Okay.#2
Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s Wow!#3
What?#3
Im sorry, its just that youre so incredibly beautiful.#3
Oh yeah well, Im sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?#2
I hope you dont think Im crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?#1
A little.   Now youre talking.#2
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?#2
I-I-Id love to. Let me just tell my friend.#1
Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?#1
She mustve left.#2
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!#0
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?#3
That's right baby.#1
All right, let me in.#2
No-no! Don't do it! Don't!#1
What?#3
He's a dropper!#1
Oh yeah, that's right!#1
I'm not a dropper!#0
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?#2
It's throwing and catching!#1
All right.#2
Oh! Oh! That's so hard.#3
Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!#1
Oh myOh good God!#3
I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!#1
Baking it didn't help, huh?#2
All right, well the place was closed. Ill just copy it later.#2
Or not. Uh, Rach, why dont you just move in with me?#1
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!#3
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no Its okay, I mean Ilook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdays thing, but we dont have to do that!#2
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youre thinking about Naked Wednesdays.#2
Thursdays clearly not good for ya, pick a day!#1
So thats two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.#1
Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.#2
Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.#1
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.#3
I was shrieking... like a Marine.#2
All right here. Watch me execute the three Ps of championship play. Power.  Precision.  and penache.#2
She's not much of a phone person.#2
Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?#2
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.#1
Ok, look, maybe I should just go.#2
Maybe you should.#1
Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?#1
You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.#2
Oh, that is so not true.#2
Oh, it is.#2
It isn't.#2
It is.#2
Isn't!#0
Okay ladies, that ends todays class, and lets remember, lets be safe out there.#2
Its a great class.#1
Thanks.#2
Yeah, yeah, I was watching.#2
Umm, hey, a couple of questions though.#2
Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?#1
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them#2
No. No-no. No. What would#1
Who? Me the attacker?#3
Im sorry Chandler, yknow you are such a sweet guy and I, I dont want to hurt you.#3
Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.#3
No-noReally?!#3
Of course!#1
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh#3
Ohh, Im sorry.#3
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.#2
What?! Anything! Anything!#1
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend.#2
This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?#1
Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?#3
Well, the heart wants what it wants. Ill see you later.#2
Okay, I got that. Ill escape over there. Ill come back over here. All right, come on#2
Hey, you guys. Listen, Im sorry that I was hogging the game beforeOh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!#1
Theyre all Chandler.#2
Chandler sucks! He couldnt have gotten this good!#3
I did.  But it came at a price.#2
But Ben is coming over tonight and he cant see this.#3
Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!#3
Sure!#1
Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right?#2
With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time!#1
And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!!#1
Okay, whatever, I really havent thought about it that much.#2
Well, I like that idea.#1
Obviously!#1
I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yknow?#2
I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like#2
No.#3
"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Lets discuss it before we reject it completely."""#1
Oh, Im sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.#3
So, thats it?#3
I just dont think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.#2
Which is why#2
What do you have against the beautiful guest room?#0
I dont have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!#1
Are you mocking me?#1
No, Im not mocking you,  or you beautiful guest room.#2
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!#1
Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.#1
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but#2
Cat.#2
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.#1
I love you too.#1
I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!#1
Why?#3
I don't know.#2
This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!#1
That's#2
Hey!#1
Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has#2
But#2
"No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, ""Ha-ha! Gotcha!"""#3
Okay. Okay, but you cant fire him today.#2
Why not?!#1
Because Im dumping him today.#1
What?! You said he was sweet!#3
He#2
Just dont pick up your phone.#2
"Then he comes over!  ""Im so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!"#3
What? So now Im not allowed to fire him?#3
You cant fire him and dump him the same day, hell kill himself.#1
Okay well then, Ill fire him today and you go out with him for another week.#2
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, Ill kill#3
Okay well, then well both do it today and hell just have to deal with it!#2
Okay. But the question is whos gonna go first. Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.#1
Really? Thats the thing Im worse at! Youll see.#1
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.#2
Well, I-I guess I gotta go.#3
Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Ill wait for you. Do you even know how long youre going to be gone?#3
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.#2
Oh. Well, Ill right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.#2
Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.#3
Chandler?#2
No!#1
Chandler!#1
Janice!#1
There you are!#3
There you are!#3
I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!#1
No! No! I wanna see you take-off.#2
Well, I then guess Im going to Yemen! Im going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?#1
Hi!#1
Hey.#2
HeyOoh, hows Hilda? Is she working out?#2
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.#2
Was she happy you gave her the job?#2
Oh, my-my new assistant was very happy that I hired my new assistant.#2
Hello?#2
Oh hey!#3
Can you, can you hang on a second?#2
Its the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.#2
can you excuse me for a minute?#2
Hey, funny you should call.#1
I was just looking over next weeks script.#2
Canceled?!#3
Like theyre taking it off the air?#3
Ohh.#2
All right, see you Monday.#2
Were not even shootin them anymore?!!#3
All right, bye!#1
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!#1
Sorry.#3
Im sorry Joey.#3
Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!#3
Its so secluded up here.#2
I know. I like it up here.#1
I feel like were the only two people in the world.  Oops. Sorry.#1
Whats the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?#1
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-Iwould youactually, would you go check on that?#3
Honey, we dont have any bears here.#2
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a#2
Okay. Ill be right back.#2
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!#3
What are#2
I came with Paul!#1
Yeah, I recognize the ankles!#2
Get up!#0
Here you go honey!#1
Ahh. Thank you!#1
Diet Coke#2
What the hell was that?!#1
A lesson in the importance of unagi.#2
Ohh,#2
Perhaps. Now Im curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to#2
All right, so we werent#2
Im sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Ilook, I just want you guys to be safe.#2
What are you doing?#2
Im leaning. This is where I lean.#2
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.#2
Brenda a bee!#3
What?#3
Yes! Its flown into your blouse and youd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!#1
I think I know whats going on here.#3
You do?#2
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but its wrong. Youre married.#3
I totally understand.  Can I#2
All right, let's do it!#1
No, no, no. What was that?#3
I know, it was the best I could get out of them.#2
Well, people!#1
People, people, people.#2
Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey.#2
Show 'em how it's done.#2
Count it off.#2
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?#2
Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and hes so cheap, hed never fly to London in a million years.#3
Yeah, invite him?#2
Hey, did I do these neat enough?#2
Yeah, theyre fine.#2
Yeah?#1
If anyone asks, well just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?#3
Sure. Why not?#2
Really?#3
Yeah?#2
I dont think Id be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.#1
Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldnt invite her?#3
Oh, no-no, yknow I absolutely adore Rachel its just that, well it might be a awkward for you.#1
But its absolutely your decision.#2
More tea?#2
Yeah sure.#2
Earl Grey?#2
Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.#1
Hi.#2
Hey!#1
Hey! So how was the doctor?#2
Oh, everything went great.#1
Good.#2
Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.#2
Oh.#1
I dont see the baby. Where is it?#2
Oh no, I know I couldnt see it either at first, but its right umm  Ross, I lost it again.#1
Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.#1
Excuse me?#2
Could you help me with something?#2
The patient Im looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair.#2
And umm, hes like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.#2
I think I know who youre talking about.#2
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?#1
Im sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff#2
Uh, shes with me.  Dr. Drake Remoray.#2
Dr. Drake who?#2
Remoray. Its Portuguese. We need that information; Im a doctor.#2
A doctor at this hospital?#3
Damnit woman were losing precious time! Now do you want this mans blood on your head?#0
Hands.#2
Hands!#2
It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in.#2
Hes a patient of mine, Ive been treating him for years!#2
Hes in room 816.#2
816, thank you!#1
Thank you.#2
And what is his name?#2
No!#3
Hi!#1
Hi!#1
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.#2
Awww.#1
Thanks a million.#1
Oh, youre welcome a million.#1
Okay, Ill see you in our room.#2
Yeah.#2
Oh my God.#3
I know.#2
Okay, I gotta go.#2
Whoa! What?! Why?!#3
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.#3
Here?! Now?!#3
Well, yeah.#2
I cant-I cant stay here all night, and if I go in there shes-shes gonna wanna... do stuff.#3
What happened?#3
Hes not gonna make it, hes stuck in Chicago.#3
Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!#1
Stupid, useless Canadian money!#0
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.#2
Really?#3
Will you call him?#2
Yes!#1
I will!#1
Absolutely!#1
(She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other.#2
She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in#2
Oh my God! That is so good!#1
Im full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, Ill regret it.#2
Hey!#2
Hey!#2
What do you got there?#2
Oh its umm, its tofu cake. Do you want some?#2
What are you doing tonight?#2
Huh? Uh#2
Dude! Dude!#3
Oh!  Sorry. Uh, Ive got those plans with Phoebe, why?#2
Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.#3
What?! Tonight?!#3
Thats what Monica said.#2
After she gave me that big speech?!#3
She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me?#0
I think shes trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!#0
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?#2
Who cares? I repel women.#3
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.#3
What?!#3
Its yours!#2
Yeah well, Im-Im a slut.#1
Me too.#2
Hi Jill!#1
Hey!#1
Hi .#2
Rachel.#2
Rachel! Well, you-youre not at home, youre-youre-youre right here.#3
Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But its not!#1
Okay. So well Ill umm,  Ill have her home by midnight.#2
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!#1
I'm sorry, man.#3
Hey, y'know what you should do?#2
You should make something happen for yourself.#2
Y'know, like-like write a play.#2
Write a movie!#1
Huh?#2
I mean, what about those#2
Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?#3
Wait a second, I could star in it!#1
Or that.#2
I can't write!#1
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?#3
I can't do it.#3
I'll help you.#2
Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.#2
And plus, it'll give me something to do.#2
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?#2
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope thats cool.#2
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.#2
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sisters beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.#2
Although, I should probably tell you, shes a porn star.#2
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think youre chances are pretty good.#2
All right.#2
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Im going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.#1
Why dont you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnt have to apologize.#2
I would really love it if I could do both.#2
All right, II have to ask.#1
What?#2
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?#3
What?!#3
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?#0
A hundred and forty-five pounds.#3
Yes, yes it is. Its uh  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!#1
Heres Frannie. Hmm, wont she be happy to see me?#1
Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didnt bring you here so you can ambush her.#0
Frannie was the one who found your#2
That bitch!#0
Monica! What#3
Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!#0
Hi Frannie, congratulations.#2
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?!#0
Why?!#3
WhatWhy wouldnt you want me at your wedding?#1
What could I have possibly done?!#1
Stuart!#0
I believe you know my husband.#2
So its really a question of#2
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?#1
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?#3
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.#2
Yeah?#3
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.#2
What's up?#2
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.#2
Man to uh, me.#2
Sure. Okay.#2
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!#3
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.#2
You mean scared.#2
No, I mean happy.#2
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.#1
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicas and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyre not moving in.#3
What do you mean, theyre not moving in? They-theyre still moving in right?#3
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.#2
What?! Over a stupid room!#3
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Im also really psyched cause I dont have to move in here!#1
Oh no, yeah no, that parts great!#1
Yes#2
Shut-out!!#3
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!#3
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!#1
Yeah, get out!#0
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!#0
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?#0
Come on, wussies!#0
All right, ok, I gotta go.#2
I'm going,  and I'm gone.#2
One more game?#2
Oh yeah!#1
Im sorry.#3
Ohhh. Dont go.#3
No, I-I-I gotta go.#1
No. No! No! No!#1
Honey, honey, people are looking.#1
I dont care!  I dont care!!#0
Yeah, um, Im, Im leaving now.#1
You cant leave! I have your shoe!#1
Good-bye Chandler Bing.#1
Rachel has those in burgendy.#2
Oh, ew!#3
What?#2
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.#2
Um, can you roll your tongue?#2
Because I can, and my Mom couldnt, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.#2
What, wait, you mean like this?#2
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.#3
Your not doing it.#2
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I cant. We dont have that....#2
Where there is no fear of commitment.#2
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?#2
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.#2
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.#2
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!#3
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.#2
Right.#2
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.#2
Amazingly, that makes sense.#1
You think?#2
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!#1
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.#3
Hey!  Hey!#1
Hi!#1
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.#1
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?#1
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.#2
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?#2
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!#3
Im missin picture time?!#1
Yknow she has a face Ross!#0
Okay. Okay, heres a good one of us.#1
Wow!#1
That is a good one!#1
Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card yknow, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.#1
Yknow, every year I say Im gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.#2
Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?#2
Together? Like-like to people?#3
Yeah, yknow. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. Itll be cute, okay?#1
Okay.#1
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?#2
Uh sure, sure.#2
Bye guys.#2
I mean, I dont feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.#1
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like youve got a girlfriend?#1
Is this about Mark?#2
Oh my God.#3
Okay, its not, its not.#2
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.#1
Fine, youre right.#2
Lets ah, lets take a break,  lets cool off, okay, lets get some frozen yoghurt, or something..#2
No. A break from us.#1
Bing! Were all set for tonight, 8 oclock.#1
Oh uh, as it turns out, we cant do it. Monica has to work.#1
Oh, my ex-wife didnt work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.#1
Oh uh well tomorrows no good for her either.#2
Oh? Why not?#1
Its the semi-finalsof herbotchy ball tournament.#2
Whats going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?#1
Well now-now youre just talking crazy.#1
So why cant the three of us go out together?#2
Because uhwe-wewe split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.#3
Good God Bing Iwell I cant say Im altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.#1
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.#1
Yknow what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?#0
Bing my boy, were gonna get you over this.#2
Now heres the plan, grab your coat, were going to a strip club.#1
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.#0
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.#2
It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.#2
: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!#0
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.#2
What are you doing?#2
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.#2
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.#2
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.#2
Did he call?#2
No. Sorry.#3
Why?! Why?! He said hed call. Why hasnt he called?#1
Maybe hes intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.#2
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasnt he called, Rachel? Why?#1
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.#2
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?#3
Well...#2
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didnt tell him not to call me, did you?#1
No. I...#2
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.#0
And youre upset because you didnt make your best friend cry?#1
I mean, all Im asking for is just a little emotion!#1
Is that too much to ask after six years?!#0
I mean what?#1
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!#1
I mean do we not have as much fun?!#1
Dont I deserve a few tears?!!#1
I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!#1
Hey!#1
I did not cry my eyes out!!#0
Come on!#1
Its like the end of an era!#3
No more J-man and Channies!#3
!#1
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!#1
Do I know why were rushing?#2
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?#2
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.#2
Oh, I found it!#1
!#3
Thats so great for you guys!#1
Yeah!#1
Good luck, with your girlfriend.#2
Oh, thank you.  Hey, hey.  Rachel!!!!#1
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.#2
Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.#2
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?#2
Yes, you can, very much.#1
Ahhhh!!#3
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!#1
Do#2
Ah,#2
Do#2
Ah,#2
DO YOU?#1
Yknow I dont understand why they didnt cry. It was a beautiful speech.#1
Oh, come on.#3
Hey!#1
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!#1
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.#2
And what you said about Nana.#2
Ohh, yeah she really wouldve wanted to be there.#1
And you know what?#2
I think she was.#2
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?#3
You forget how many great songs Heart had.#2
Yeah.#2
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.#2
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.#1
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Im not even sure I got it.#2
What, you didnt get it? The doctor is a monkey.#2
And monkeys cant write out prescriptions.#2
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.#1
Your joke? Well, I think the Hef would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.#2
I cant find garbage bags!#0
Oh, I think I saw some in here.#2
What is it?!#3
I dont know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itll die.#3
I cant believe were living here!#1
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing?#3
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.#1
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!#3
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.#1
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.#1
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.#3
Okay, look, just do it gently.#2
You’re right.#2
You’re right.#2
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.#2
I can do that.#2
I am a gentle person.#2
Oh, by the  way.#2
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.#2
Hi, Pheebs?#2
Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.#2
What?!#1
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.#1
Which#2
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?#2
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.#2

Its not!#1
I mean you were just Youre so incredible!#1
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me!#1
Yknow Im just gonnaI, I am gonna make this up to you!#1

Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape.#2
No.  And then I called him, and he wasnt there.#2
Well, then hes, hes probably just, out.#2
Oh, thank you thats very helpful, Im glad you came over.#1
Hello.#2
Hi! Its me.#1
Hi! Oh, Im so glad you called.#1
Really? Ive been thinking, this is crazy, I mean dont, dont you think we can work on this?#1
Hey, what do you want to drink?#2
Whos that?#3
Nobody.#2
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?#2
Is that Mark?#2
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....#2
Yeah! Got it!#1
Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.#1
Ah, thats okay, thanks.#1
Hey, you dont have to smile. You just have to dance.#2
Look, I dont feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?#1
Oh, okay.  Hey, two beers.#2
You wanna go in the bedroom? Its a little more comfortable.#2
Sure.#2
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?#3
If this is your idea of sexy talk?#3
No seriously, yknow the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?#1
What contracts?#2
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I dont get.#1
Like what?#2
Yknow, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?#3
Tag!#0
Im serious!#0
This isnt funny!#0
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!#0
Rach, Im sorry, but you didnt give me any contracts!#3
Yes I did! And I put a little#0
Im telling you, you never gave them to me.#2
Yknow what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.#0
No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are#1
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!#3
You wanna go down to the office right now?#2
No! Come on its late, were not gonna go down to the office.#0
Okay I understand.  I wouldnt want to be proved wrong either.#2
Okay get your coat!  Oh! When did you unhook this?  Nice work!#1
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this    is my good friend Ross.#2
Nice to meet you.#2
Oh and I need to talk to you.#2
About what?#2
To see if know what these guys are talking about.#2
Pheebs, hows it going?#2
Im doing okay. I think its going well. Do you think theyre having fun? Am I talking to fast?#2
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, its going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.#1
Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before?#2
Oh right, Coach Ruben.#2
Do you know what Pheebs?#2
When youre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too.#3
Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.#2
See thats where I think that youre wrong. Weve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.#2
What do you mean?#3
Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!#0
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!#0
Uh, what was that?#3
Uh,#2

That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...#2
Okay.#2
Bye.#2
Whoo-hoo!#1
Yeah, there you go!#1
Second date!#1
...I dunno.#2
You#2
Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay?#1
I mean,... how needy is that?#3
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?#2
You're so pretty.#1
Hi!#1
Hey, Phoebe.#2
Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.#2
You talked to him. Are you crazy?#3
Thank you, Happy Holidays.#1
Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't  Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!#0
Hey!!#1
The charity's on fire!#3
Help!#3
Oh good!#1
Thank you, I need that.#1
Whoa!#3
What is that?!#3
It's nine o'clock in the morning!#3
Can I help you?#2
Uh yeah, where-wheres the guy who decides whos pictures go up on the wall?#2
Hes not here right now.#2
Oh, youre kidding me!#0
All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes.#2
Okay?#2
Im an actor; Im kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.#2
Yknow, there are two people who could put your picture up there.#2
Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?  Youre the other one right?#2
Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.#1
What?! Youre crazy! Theres nothing sexual about the noises I make!#3
Really?#3
Theres nothing sexual about this?#1
Oooh.#1
Oo God!#1
Ohh.#1
Ohhhh.#1
Ohh.#1
What are you looking at?!#1
I mean hi.#2
Oh myThis is so embarrassing. Oh my God, Im never gonna get massaged again!#1
No, you cant let this stop you from getting massages!#1
No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!#2
Really?!#3
Well not clients, lovers. But lets just yknow, try it again. Come back and-and well work through it.#2
Are you sure?#3
Yes.#2
I guess.#2
Great! Okay, if youll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?#1
Noo!!!#1
Yes!#1
Noo!!#1
Yes!!#1
Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.#3
Okay, heres the thing. Were gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youre drunk.#2
Really?! You promise?#1
Yeah, Ill take care of it.#2
Okay. I love you so much.#1
Okay we have to do something about your breath.#2
What about#3
Thats still yours. Okay, now remember its a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.#2
Okay. I can do that.#2
Okay.#2
Surprise!!!#3
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.#2
Yeah, were done.#2
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?#3
Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?#1
Really?!#3
No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.#2
Sweet!#1
All right, well finish your coffee; lets go.#2
Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.#3
Uh actually, sorry I cant even make it. Im seeing Mona again tonight.#2
I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?#1
Im sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby#3
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?#2
Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.#1
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.#2
She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!#1
Oh, what a fun office.#1
I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette.#2
So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?#2
Rachel? Do you smoke?#2
Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror storiesabout ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.#2
What?#2
Peach pit.#2
Yes, Bunny?#2
Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-#2
-Peaches?#2
Actually, nectarines, but basically...#2
Could've been a peach.#2
Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.#2
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.#1
All right!#1
Westminster Abbey!#1
Hands down, best Abbey Ive ever seen.#1
Hey!#1
Okay.#2
What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?#2
I think its great. Its great. Yknow, theyre thinking of changing the name of this place.#2
Really? To what?#3
To Put the Camera Away!!!#1
Man,#2
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And#3
Chandler, theres a guy right over there.#2
Thats a mailman! Thats#3
Chandler, dont worry! This doesnt make you any less of a guy!#2
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?#2
Hmm.#2
Eh..., I dont, I dont know.#1
What?#2
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?#1
Rachel?#2
Yeah.#2
Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?#2
Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?#1
Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.#2
Eh, do you believe that?#1
Yeah?#2
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.#1
No, you said the baby creeps you out.#2
No, the little girl creeps me out.#1
You said the baby.#2
Why would the baby creep me out?#1
Why would the little girl creep you out?#1
You guys, Im sorry, could you please talk a little slower?#2
This is going in your book?#3
Yeah, its about relationships. Yknow? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!#1
What?! Excuse me!#3
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.#2
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as its a compliment.#2
Yeah!!!!#1
Yes, I made it!#1
Im on time!#1
Okay, why dont we all uh,  open our books to page 23.#2
Where  Where you will seea uha bunch of uhred spots.#2
Okay,  umm, why dont, why dont you all start to read, while I#2
Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?#1
Ross! What are you I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.#1
Hey! Y'know that teacher who had a baby with her student?#2
What the? What#3
Hi!#1
Miss? May I help you?#2
Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay?#1
But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment.#2
So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.#3
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?#2
Do you want me to be afraid of you?#2
Of course not.#2
I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.#1
I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.#1
Really?#3
Of course!#2
Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.#1
All right, hold on okay? First thing's first.  Okay, now did Ross sit#2
Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is#0
A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!#3
Ooh, it's not a toy.#1
Well, I don't know what else to do.#3
I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30!#1
So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it!#1
'Cause I-I got nothing!#1
All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.#1
Okay then.#2
Here we go.#2
Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again?#1
Ask again later.#2
Later is not good enough.#0
Ask again later.#2
What the hell!#0
This is broken!#0
It-it is broken!#0
All right, let me see.  Will Chandler have sex tonight?  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.#2
Excuse me.#2
Yeah?#2
Are you Phoebe Buffay?#2
Yeah.#2
Can-can I get your autograph, Im your biggest fan.#1
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...#2
Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.#1
No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.#1
Come on, two on one.#2
What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!#3
What, now?#3
Yes, now is when you swoop!#1
You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not!#1
You're like, like the anti-Paolo!#1
My Catholic friend is right.#2
She's distraught.#2
You're there for her.#2
You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!#1
Well, I just called Joshua#2
Oh, how did it go?#1
Well, I did my best to convince him that Im not some crazy girl who is dying to get marriedIm just going through a hard time.#2
What did he say?#2
Well uh, his answering machine was#1
Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that hes gonna call you again.#1
Yeah, maybe, but I dont think I even care.#3
I dont think hes the one Im sad about.#3
Yknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I dont think Im handling it all that well.#3
Yeah, maybe.#3
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.#3
Any luck?#1
Well, yeah, yknow how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?#3
I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.#3
Again. Yknow what? I think we all did.#1
Hey!#1
I dont get it!#3
It was in my room all night!#1
And if she didnt take it, and I didnt take it; and you  didnt take it, then who did?#1
Shh!#0
Were trying to think!#0
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.#2
What?!#3
Oh yeah!#1
I got in there myself once.#2
My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnt, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.#2
Yeah.#2
It was funny til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.#1
No, you, you cant fit in that thing. Thats not deep enough.#2
Oh yeah?  If I cant, Ill knock five bucks off the price off the unit.#1
All right, you have yourself a deal.#2
Okay.  See?! I told ya!#3
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!#1
Hey! Whats up?#2
Hey!#1
Hey-hey, whos your friend?  Hey!!#1
Hey Joey!#1
Erin! Still here!#1
Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!#1
Why wouldnt ya? Erin is great! Then-then theres you guys.#1
Ohh, listen. Ive got to get going. Today was great, thanks!#1
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.#1
Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just#2
Really?!#3
Ohh!#3
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.#2
Really?!#3
Yeah!#1
I mean you definitely should do that.#2
Y'know what, I should do it.#1
Yeah!#1
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.#1
Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!#2
All right.#2
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.#1
This woman's living my life.#0
What?#3
She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me!#0
Look at this, look.#1
She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.#1
She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people.#1
She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.#1
You're not an artist.#2
Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.#1
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.#3
No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.#1
I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.#2
Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!#1
I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!#3
Oh, that is so sick.#3
I feel violated. And not in a good way.#3
How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!#3
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?#1
Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.#1
I know. My arm is killing me.#1
No, I meant with the dropper over here.#2
Y'know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay? I'm#0
Hey Rach, can you pass me the#2
Yep!#2
Go!!#1
What?!! Stop it! Stop it! Oh my God!#3
Okay! Okay! Okay!  We'll see you in about 3 to 4 hours.#1
Oh!#3
Hey!#1
Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!#1
Oh, thanks, thanks.#1
So Monica tells me that uh, you dont want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent.#2
Is that true?#2
Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.#2
Pheebs#2
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.#1
What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.#1
Hey.#2
I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.#2
Whats the matter?#2
Nothing.#2
What is it? Hey!#1
Really its nothing. Im just#3
Rach come on, what?#2
Ive just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.#3
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?#3
Oh please, hell be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.#3
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?#2
Im just saying that yknow, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody andhes gonna have his own life. Right?#3
Yeah, I guess so.#2
I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?#3
Bob. Bob! Bob!!!  What the hell are you doing?!#3
I just found out this is Chandlers office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!#1
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.#1
We said seven!#0
We said six!#0
The only way that I said six would be if the sevens, let meet at seven, not at six.#2
"Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldve said something like this, ""Wow! My boyfriends such a wise assseven!"""#0
Hi!#1
Oh my good God.#3
Ugh!#3
I know what time you said.#1
What?!#3
Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.#2
You, get out of my shop!#0
Well, what did he do?#3
He went out with my wife!#0
Joey!#3
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-IHey! I did#1
Thats my wife!!! Get out!#0
Well, we should go.#2
Yeah.#2
Yknow you, really didnt have to take me to the airport.#2
Oh please.#2
Every moment is precious.#1
Yknow?#2
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends dont really seem to care too much that youre leaving.#1
Well, were really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.#2
On no! No! Its not good-bye, Im not leaving until you get on that plane.#1
No, Im afraid I wont be able to make love as well as him.#1
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.#2
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.#2
So big deal, so Joeys had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnt mean hes great in bed.#2
We share a wall! So either hes great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.#2
Sweetie, with you its gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, cause you-you guys are in love.#1
Yeah?#3
Yeah!#1
Just go for it Chandler.#2
Yeah, you should.#2
Yeah, you should, really.#2
Go on.#2
All right, all right, Ill go sleep with my girlfriend. But Im just doing it for you guys.#2
: Im sure as hell a dancer, its no use Marge will never go for me.#1
Come on Treeger, dont say that.#1
You just ahh, you just need more practice.#2
Here, come on, lets ahh, lets try it again.#2
Come on.#2
Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway.#1
I mean, yknow, Im not really that comfortable dancing with a We-he!!#1
Hey!#1
: Yeah!#1
Oh, I#2
Are you sure? Ill bet theres another flight to Minsk in like#2
July. Umm,#2
Thats really beautiful. What does it mean?#1
Please, clean my beakers. I dont get out of the lab much.#2
Thats good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.#1
Yeah, I Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldnt because yknow, Ihave to leave.#2
Youre right! Youre right. Dont say it.#1
I-I do though.#1
I do too.#1
Bye Phoebe.#2
Okay, nows not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.#1
I know.#2
Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that?#3
Listen, Im gettin something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?#1
No, I do not hear that.#2
Yeah, I-I heard.  I think its great!  Ohh, Im so happy for you!#1
Oh, well, thats great!#1
Yeah! Yeah!#1
I cant believe youre getting married!#1
Yeah.#2
Monica and Rachel made out.#2
Ohhh!#3
Why are we in bed together?#3
I dont know. Do-do you have any clothes on?#2
Yeah.#2
Really?!#3
No!#2
But we-we didnt havesex-uh, did we?#3
I mean, I dont remember much about last night, it was such a blur.#2
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.#1
And we didnt have sex.#2
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. Im just glad we didnt do anything stupid.#2
Tell me about it.#2
What are we gonna do?#2
I say we go with#2
Chandler?#2
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?#2
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?#1
Whats that smell?#3
I know!#1
Hi, remember us?#2
Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a#2
I am. I'm#2
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.#2
Yeah, I know...  ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.#3
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.#2
Yknow what? It#2
Sorry.#2
Im so exited!#1
Ive been waiting for this for months!#1
I got my hair coloured!#1
I got new sheets!#1
Im making him a#1
Um-hmm.#2
What am I making him by the way?#2
Well, youre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.#2
I thought I was making him filet mignon?#3
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.#2
And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.#1
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.#3
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, dont worry about it!#1
Im not worried, Im uh, Im fascinated.#1
Yknow its like uh, Biology!#2
Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.#1
Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.#2
Phoebe!#1
If you wouldve let me finish, it goes on to say that hes probably not gay.#2
You are falling fast asleep.#2
Deeper.#2
Deeper.#2
Deeper.#2
You are now completely asleep.#2
You dont need to smoke.#2
Cigarettes dont control you.#2
You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.#2
A strong, confident woman.#2
Thank you for your patience, youre the next caller.#2
Yes!! Yes!! Im the next caller! You were gonna have me hang up.#1
Hey! Can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre?#2
Of course not.#1
No.#2
Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.#2
So how are things going with Paul?#2
Good.#1
Although yknow, he-hes a private guy.#1
Yknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.#3
Thats easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wont open.#2
So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?#3
No thats what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.#2
Hi honey.#2
Hi!#1
Okay, Ben, I wont tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you dont tell about our little bonking incident.#3
Monica, number one, I dont think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...   What?!#3
You said number two.#2
I also said number one.#2
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.#2
Cant I just look at the handles on them?#2
You would think.#2
Okay, fine.#2
Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why Im a terrible waitress?#1
Because, I dont care.#2
I dont care.#2
I dont care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I dont care where the tray spot is, I just dont care, this is not what I want to do.#1
So I dont think I should do it anymore.#1
Im gonna give you my weeks notice.#1
What?!#3
Gunther, I quit.#1
Does this mean were gonna have to start paying for coffee?#3
Ohh, I mean its just so realistic!#1
I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.#2
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!#1
Do you uh, do youready for a refill?#2
Oh, I probably shouldntso I will!  Oh! Wow! Its like its raining!#3
Pretty cool, huh?#1
But if youre thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldnt get sucked up into the mechanism, well youd be wrong.#2
Umm, can I use your bathroom?#2
Its uh, right through there.#2
Okay.  God yknow, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbianis apartment#1
Yeah, lifes pretty great isnt it?#1
Yeah, it sure is!#1
You know, I think I was sixteen.#2
Please, just a little bit off the back.#2
"I'm still on ""no."""#2
Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?#2
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.#0
What's goin' on?#2
Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.#2
What stupid thing did you do?#1
Ewww!#3
I know.#2
See, yes.#2
Thats Yasmine Bleeth, shes a completely different kind of chick.#2
I love you both.#2
But in very different ways.#2
Hey!#3
Hey!#3
(sees hes watching#2
I did! But the store wouldnt take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?#1
If they cant find a home for her, they kill her! And Im not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!#1
Okay, good, good, good, cause, good, cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.#1
Okay. And its not just chicks y'know? Its all kinds of other animals!#3
Thats horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.#3
Thanks, Im glad you see it that way.#1
Ohhh-hoo, funny story!#1
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?#2
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.#1
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?#2
Ohh, he's really shy. I-I dont think he's up to meeting everyone yet.#2
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.#2
I dont care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!#1
Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?#3
I might've said that.  Why is that funny?#2
Because I'm very happy for him!  And#1
Hi!#1
All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.#2
Okay.#2
All right, let's go say good-bye.#2
Hey!#2
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment?#0
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!#3
Fish!#3
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.#2
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here#3
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.#1
We did have fun, didn't we?#1
We did!#1
Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.#2
Oh, I would love to!#1
Yay, okay!#1
Good, good, good, good, good.#1
Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.#2
Um...  Done!#2
Youre, hey, youre not paying for the pizza!#3
Oh come on, its only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?#2
Ahh, Id throw another thousand on that.#2
Why, how much is that?#2
Thats about 60 cents.#2
Okay, its coffee.#2
Ice coffee? Tell me its ice coffee!#3
Its-its hot#2
Hot coffee!!!#3
You idiot!!#0
You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!!#0
What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?!#0
Huh?#1
!#0
Whats your favourite thing about summertime?#2
Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.#2
Yeah#2
Hey!#3
Tommyyyy! Say, whats your favourite thing about summer?#1
Ooh, I dont know. Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.#2
Ohh, thats a good one.#1
OK, try this salmon mousse.#2
Mmmm. Good.#1
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?#2
It's creamier.#1
Yeah, well, is that#2
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?#3
My God! What happened to you?#3
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?#3
"""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""#1
That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!#1
Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really#1
Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!#1
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.#1
Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.#2
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.#2
Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!#1
Sweetie, you think you can get in there?#2
I don't see why not.#2
Here's my retainer!#2
Someone in there?#2
No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called wait until the last moment before I burst and die.#1
Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?#3
Someone was in the lady's room, I couldnt wait. I left the lid up for ya though.#2
Y'know what Gunther, go ah, go ahead, Im-Im talking to ah, .  This is the part where you say your name.#2
Ginger.#2
Ginger. Im talking to Ginger, so....#2
Dont you have to use the bathroom?#2
Nope, nope, Id just ah, Id rather talk to you.#2
Yes, I do.#2
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.#2
Someone in here.#2
Im going to keep dating him Mother, and theres nothing you can do about it!#0
Oh yes there is!#0
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!#0
That was an accident! And so were you.#0
Well, at least Im not a murderer!#0
Oh, my baby!#1
That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?#3
Oh, just years of experience.#2
Can I get some ice here?!#1
Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.#1
Youre not the fan whos dying are you?#1
Say what?#3
Im supposed to meet and hug a fan who's dying, but thats not supposed to be until  later!#2
No. No, Im Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-Im the guy in the coma!#1
Oh that was a real person?!#3
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since Im getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me#1
I-I-Im leaving the show?#3
I dont know. Why? Did you hear something?#2
Who told you that?#3
Oh uh, one of the writers.#1
Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?#3
Umm#2
Feel better?#2
Yeah!#1
Much!#1
Listen uh, not that Im yknow insecure about my manhood or anything yknow, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.#1
Yeah, I understand.#2
Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!#1
Hi!#1
Yknow, you look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?#3
I dont think so.#2
Oh! Maybe its because Im on television. Im an actor on#1
Wow!#3
Yeah.#2
Really?!#3
Hm-mmm.#2
$4.50 please.#2
Oh, let me get this.    These are for you.#2
Alright, alright, alright.#2
It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word.#1
Oh God, do something.#1
Just make contact, smile!#1
There you go!#1
You're definitely scaring here.#1
Would you like to call somebody?#2
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.#2
Okay! Feel free to look, but Im telling you those contracts are not on this desk.#0
Oh#2
Its my sister.#2
Okay, very cute braces. Anyway yknow what, the#2
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?#1
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a#2
Phoebe, she doesnt know that you sneak out every night, she doesnt know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesnt know that youve been living with your Grandmothers for a week now.#2
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.#2
Hey.#2
Hey.#2
Im never gonna find a roommate, ever.#3
Why, nobody good?#2
Well lets see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thats plural.#3
The spitter.#3
Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it.#1
Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing#2
So how many more do you have tomorrow?#2
Two.#2
This photographer, who seemed really dull.#2
And this actor guy, who Im not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Chandler Bing, he said Whoa-whoa, short message.#2
Ross , foot on the floor or come over no more!#2
Sure, your dresser is missing but this she notices.#1
What?#2
I have to go. Yeah, Carol should be home by now, soo...#2
Umm, hows it going with you guys?#2
Oh, better, actually. Y'know I-I-I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately.#2
Oh, really?#3
Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesnt really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think its gonna make a difference#1
Hey!#2
Hi!#2
What-what are-what are these?#1
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyd brighten up the place. They do dont you think?#1
No-no-no, no!#1
Well, how-how come?#2
Thats just the way it is.#2
Thats crazy.#3
Maybe its crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.#2
See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now Peter!#2
Hey, Peter!#2
Its me Rhonda!#2
From PS-129!#2
I shared my puddin which you man!#1
I gave you my#2
I-I think everybodys pretending they dont hear you.#2
Anyway, look, I dont know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Im telling you, he#2
Thats okay, Im cool over here. Ill catch up with you later, Joey.#2
Op, this is saved.  Gift shop.#2
Hows that coffee comin, dear?#2
Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.#2
Im not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.#2
I know!#1
Ill bet your thinking, Whats an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee? Eh?#3
Op.#2
Eh.#1
Oh, you got me.#2
Well, dont think I havent noticed your potential.#2
Well, Ive got a project for you thats a lot more related to fashion.#2
How does that sound?#2
Oh, that sounds great.#1
Come on over here, sweetheart.#2
Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.#1
Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe youd want to get back together?#3
No. But thanks.#2
Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?#3
Okay. No. But thanks.#2
Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.#2
Wow, that was kinda brutal.#3
Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right.#2
Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, yknow.#2
Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing,#2
Yeah, sure.#2
Wow.#3
I'm, I'm really sorry.#2
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.#2
Relieved?#3
Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.#2
She wants#2
Oh my God! If you say that one more time,#0
Fine!#0
Fine!#0
But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  If you accept full responsibility...  Full responsibility!#0
...I can begin to trust you again.#0
Does that seem like something you can do.#0
Does it?!#0
!#0
No?#3
Look, Ross, you have what you want, youre back with Rachel.#2
If you bring this up now youre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.#2
Yeah, I know.#3
I mean, no, youre right.#3
Yeah I guess Ill let it go.#2
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.#3
Sure, its hard to forget!#2
But that doesnt mean you have to talk about it!#2
A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.#2
What the hell happened on that beach?!#3
Its between us and the sea, Ross!#2
I didnt think you were gay. I do now.#1
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.#2
Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Im not looking for any thing serious.#3
Oh, yknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.#2
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?#3
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.#2
Oh wow! Im free for her!#1
Oh, wait a second! I didnt say I wasnt free!#3
Hey, Chandler, why dont we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?#2
Hold on, yknow I#2
Oh well, thats uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!#1
Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.#2
Well, I dont really know what that is, but#2
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.#2
Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.#2
Yeah, save it for the cab, okay.#3
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.#3
What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.#2
Joey, get out of the fridge.#0
All right, all right.#1
What is that?#3
For the ride.#2
Yeah, like in a cab...#2
Save it.#2
Okay, hating this.#3
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.#2
I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.#1
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.#3
All right, I'm going. I'm going.#1
Here we go, here we go.#2
Rossy, Rossy.#2
WHAT IS IT?!#1
Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.#1
Yes. Absolutely. A quality.#2
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.#2
Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.#1
Oh my God! Calling from Rome!#3
So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.#2
Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.#1
Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.#1
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.#1
Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.#1
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk.#2
You know it?#3
Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?#2
Oh, sure, they love us over there.#2
Ben! Ben! Ben!#1
Gimme em!#0
No! They are mine!#0
You stole them from me!#0
You stole them from me!!#0
Gimme them!#0
You just wanna each take one?#2
Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.#2
Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?#1
Well#2
Why dont you phase it out?#2
Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youre, yknow, that youre adjusting to life in America.#1
Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyre probably not even listening!#2
Theyre not listening too me?#3
Of course theyre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.#2
Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?#1
I think you look fine.#2
How about Joey... Pepponi?#2
No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.#2
Joey... Switzerland?#2
Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe.#2
Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.#1
Which I'm not.#2
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?#1
Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.#2
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...#2
Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.#1
Might wanna try Joseph.#2
Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!#1
Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.#1
Are you kidding?#3
Okay, look.#2
I-I studied evolution.#1
Remember, evolution?#1
Monkey into man?#1
Plus, Im a doctor, and I had a monkey.#2
Im Doctor Monkey!#1
Im not arguing with that.#2
All right, Ive heard enough. Ive made my decision.#1
You are both idiots.#3
The joke is not funny, and its offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys!#3
You shouldnt be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!#0
Now let it go!#0
The joke sucks!#0
Its your joke.#2
Is not.#0
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.#1
I didnt!#1
Even when I found outumm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.#2
Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.#1
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!#3
Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and#2
Did you, did you#1
No.#2
Give me your hands.  Strings. Gimme it!  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?#1
Yes!#1
Then don't touch one!!#0
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!#3
Yeah!#1
Thanks!#1
All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.#2
Done!#1
And it can't be Joey.#1
It's not.#2
Or Joseph.#2
Oh.#1
Hi!#2
Hi! Hey, Pete youre back! Hey, check this out.#1
Wow! Skates!#1
Wow! Youre a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was youre trip?#3
Well...#2
Oh, whatd ya bring me?!#1
Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan.#1
Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection.#1
You want some coffee?#2
Yeah, sure, thatd be great.#2
Regular or decaf?#2
Ah, which ever is closest.#2
Okay.#2
So ask me what I did today.#2
So what did you do today Pete?#2
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.#1
What?! Oh.#3
Hi.#2
Hey.#2
Where've you been?#2
At the vet.#2
She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?#3
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.#1
Hey! He beat ya.#1
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.#3
So what does this mean?#2
I'm gonna have to give him up.#3
Aww man! I cant believe I locked myself out again!#0
Hang on buddy!#1
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?#3
I sure did.#2
But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.#3
Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?#1
May I come in?#2
Uh, yeah, if you want too.#2
Do#2
Yeah, sure?#2
So do I.#2
Okay Rach, before anything happens  I just want to lay down a couple of ground rules.#2
This is just about tonight.#2
"I don't to go through with this if it's going to raise the question of ""Us."""#2
Okay?#2
I just want this to be  about what it is!#1
And um, what-what is that Ross?#1
The physical act of love.#1
What?! Are you crazy?#3
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?#3
Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!#3
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.#1
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!#1
No! No!  No!  No-no-no-no.#1
Ohh wow! Im sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!#3
Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?#2
It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.#3
Yeah, the phone was facing the other way.  And that goes back up there.#2
Ah Joey.#2
Joey Tribbiani.#2
Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.#2
So, does that mean the audition is off?#1
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.#2
What?!#3
Aw come on Joey, it's easy.#2
Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!#2
It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.#1
Have fun.#2
Bye.#2
Wow! Fortunately she has a#3
Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!#3
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!#3
!#3
Hi there.#2
Hi.#2
Hi.#2
I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.#2
Ok.#2
Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know!#2
So, keep having sex on a regular basis.#2
Oh, DAMN IT!#0
Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.#2
Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.#2
Ok.#2
Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-#2
Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.#1
We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!#1
Yeah! C'mon!#1
Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-#2
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?#2
No, she's at a faculty meeting.#2
